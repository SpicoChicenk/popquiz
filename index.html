    <p>There is 4 Branches I've made for:
        <ol>
            <li>
                html-css 
            </li>
            <li>
                videoembed
            </li>
            <li>
                methodflow
            </li>
            <li>
                gitcommands
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            I've chosen to lay it out this way because that's how I think it would be laid out judging by how the file is structured and the addition of features to it. It goes from creating the file, into the added information to it.
